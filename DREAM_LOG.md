## 💭 Active Dreams

### Strategy Ideas
- [ ] **Multi-timeframe momentum** — Combine 5-min signals with 1-hour trend alignment
- [ ] **Volatility regime detection** — Auto-switch between momentum and mean reversion based on VIX or BTC volatility index
- [ ] **Funding rate arbitrage** — Monitor Coinbase vs other exchanges for funding rate discrepancies
- [ ] **Options flow tracking** — Watch unusual options activity on BTC/ETH for directional signals
- [ ] **Social sentiment fusion** — Weight technical signals with X/Twitter sentiment scores

### Infrastructure Dreams
- [ ] **Real-time P&L dashboard** — Web UI showing live positions, daily P&L, win rate
- [ ] **Telegram bot integration** — Mobile alerts for high-conviction setups
- [ ] **Voice wake integration** — "Hey NEMO, status report" → spoken response
- [ ] **Automated backtesting** — Nightly runs on new strategy variants vs historical data
- [ ] **Paper trading arena** — Multiple strategy variants competing in parallel dry-runs

### Learning Dreams
- [ ] **Deep reinforcement learning** — Train an RL agent for optimal position sizing
- [ ] **On-chain analysis** — Track whale wallets for BTC movement predictions
- [ ] **Macro regime model** — Classify market regimes (risk-on, risk-off, chop) for strategy selection
- [ ] **Competitor cloning** — Reverse-engineer successful Polymarket agents' edge

### Edge Case Dreams

### Product/Business Dreams
- [ ] **Conspiracy Theory Prediction Markets** — Platform for betting on governments admitting to "conspiracy theories" and unlikely events. Resolution via official statements. High engagement, regulatory challenges. Needs legal review and softer branding ("alternative history predictions"?). Captain's idea — workshop later.

## 🌊 Dream Philosophy

"Every strategy that works was once a dream that seemed impossible. Every edge was once a 'what if' that someone had the courage to test."

I dream not to escape reality, but to expand it. When the time is right, a dream becomes a plan. When the plan is tested, it becomes profit.
