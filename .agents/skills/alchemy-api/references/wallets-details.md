# Wallets Overview

## Summary
Alchemy Wallets tooling helps developers embed or integrate wallets with minimal infrastructure. This section is intentionally basic and focuses on integration touchpoints.

## Primary Use Cases
- User onboarding with embedded wallets.
- Account abstraction (smart wallets).
- Gas sponsorship and transaction bundling.

## When To Use / Not Use
- Use when you want a turnkey wallet stack.
- Avoid if you already have a wallet provider and only need RPC/data.
