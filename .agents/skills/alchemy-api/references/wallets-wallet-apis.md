# Wallet APIs

## Summary
High-level wallet APIs enable programmatic wallet operations such as signing, transaction preparation, or account management. This guide stays minimal and focuses on integration awareness.

## Primary Use Cases
- Server-side transaction preparation.
- Delegated signing or session-based flows.

## Integration Notes
- Prefer client-side signing for user security.
- Use server-side APIs only with strong access controls.
