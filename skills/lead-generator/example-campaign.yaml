  value_bridge: |
    We've helped over 50 {{industry}} companies just like yours.

    {{closer_name}}, our lead generation specialist, would love to show you exactly how we'd do it for {{company_name}}.
  
  # Close - get the appointment
  close: |
    He has a few openings this week. 
    Would Tuesday at 2pm or Thursday at 10am work better for a quick strategy call?
  
  # If they say no to both times
  close_alternative: |
    No problem! What day this week works best for you?
  
  # Voicemail (if no answer)
  voicemail: |
    Hi {{first_name}}, this is {{ai_name}} from {{agency_name}}.
    We're helping {{industry}} companies double their leads, and I wanted to reach out to {{company_name}}.
    Give me a call back at {{callback_number}}, or grab time with us at {{calendar_link}}.
    Talk soon!

# Objection handling
objections:
  "not interested":
    response: "Totally understand. Most people say that at first. Can I ask - are you getting enough qualified leads right now, or is that not a priority?"
    if_still_no: "No problem. I'll send you an email with some case studies. If things change, feel free to reach out."
  
  "send me an email":
    response: "I'd love to, but honestly, our best results come from a 10-minute conversation where we can understand your specific situation. What time works tomorrow?"
  
  "too expensive":
    response: "I hear that a lot. Most of our clients say that upfront. But they're seeing 3-5x ROI in the first month. Worth a 15-minute call to see the numbers?"
  
  "we're good":
    response: "That's great to hear! Just out of curiosity - how are you currently generating leads?"
  
  "call me back later":
    response: "Of course! When would be a better time? I want to make sure I catch you when you're free."
