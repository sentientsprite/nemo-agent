# 2026-02-26 Session C — Agent Body Framework Q&A (Recovered from Previous Session)

## King's Answers to Framework Questions

### Trading Architecture Decisions
1. **Trading bot should be configurable** for Polymarket, Kalshi, OR crypto CEX/DEXs
2. **Should be a sub-agent** (or compatible plugin) — concern about 24/7 market monitoring consistency
3. **"Ready for first trade"** should be specific to a trading agent/skills — keep core Nemo operational separately
4. **Friend's Polymarket bot** was losing more than profiting — King got the code (poly-bot-backup repo)

### Trading Bot Design Choices
- **Coinbase**: Strategy A & B (separate from prediction markets)
- **Kalshi/Polymarket**: Strategy C & D (copy trading approach)
- **Data source**: API primary, eventually websocket
- **State management**: Option C or B
- **Trigger**: Both types
- **Focus**: Coinbase first (different than prediction markets), then simple Kalshi/Polymarket copy trading

### Communication Style
- King said: "Keep doing what you're doing, its fine for now until we have had some time to make things shipshape"
- Confirmed current long-form style is OK for now

### Budget Constraints
- **Max $200/month on API credits**
- Track and report usage

### Other Decisions
- King said "F all of those" to one set of options (need more context on which)
- "Move on from trading questions, I'll get you more info tomorrow" — then provided poly-bot code next morning

## Key Takeaway
King wants a **modular trading system**: Nemo core stays operational, trading is a sub-agent/plugin that can target multiple platforms. Coinbase CEX trading is separate workstream from prediction market trading.
