# 2026-02-25 — Day 1: Full Setup

## What Happened
- Established identity: Nemo 🐠
- Discord connected, DM pairing complete with King
- X/Twitter logged in as @sentient_sprite via browser
- Gateway running as LaunchAgent on port 3000
- Web dashboard built at localhost:8420
- Registered on Moltbook as "sentient_sprite"
- Security hardening: loopback bind, DM allowlist, Docker sandbox, Tailscale
- X API configured and verified (posting blocked by 402)
- OpenClaw forked to ~/spryte-engine/ (~488MB, git initialized)
- URL queue: ALL 41/41 URLs processed and analyzed
- Token efficiency: LM Studio running, Kimi K2.5 configured, Nomic Embed for free memory
- Skills installed: find-skills, agent-browser, reflection, systematic-debugging
- Agent intelligence improved with Boris Cherny's tips and @kloss_xyz body framework

## Key Decisions
- Security first approach
- Discord DM only (locked to King's user ID)
- Model routing: Opus for main, Kimi K2.5 for sub-agents, local for embeddings
- OpenClaw fork is MIT licensed, legal to fork
- Skip Brave Search, use browser instead
- X posting isn't important (reading via browser sufficient)

## Lessons Learned
- `nemo doctor --non-interactive` wipes all config — never run it
- Don't edit nemo.json with Python scripts
- Gateway bind only accepts enum values (auto/lan/loopback/custom/tailnet)
- ClawHub installs to ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/ — must copy to ~/nemo-agent/skills/
- Kimi K2.5 is NOT free but ~50x cheaper than Opus
