# 2026-02-26 Session B — Polymarket Bot Review

## Key Event
- King shared his friend's Polymarket BTC 5-min bot: `github.com/sentientsprite/poly-bot-backup` (private repo, cloned via gh)
- Original source: a21ai/poly-bot
- ~4,300 LOC Python, production-quality

## Bot Architecture
- **strategy.py** — Round state machine: observation → early_entry → entry_window → hold → settlement
- **Strategies**: momentum following, mean reversion (reversal on >$300 prev candle), late snipe (last 30s)
- **Risk**: 75% stop-loss, late rescue at -50%, profit exit near round end, hedging, max 5 entries/round
- **Stack**: Python 3.11+, Polymarket CLOB API, BTC price feed, on-chain claim sweeps
- **Extras**: Next.js dashboard, landing page, learner module (adaptive filtering)

## Key Files
- `/tmp/poly-bot-backup/` — cloned repo
- Core: config.py, strategy.py, executor.py, price_feed.py, risk.py, learner.py, market.py, claimer.py, ledger.py, main.py

## Dry-Run Results
- Bot ran successfully in dry-run mode with King's credentials
- Wallet: 0x6Ca15Ec1764A7cE16B7ada4eC29934923f756a8a (Polymarket proxy)
- Private key stored ONLY in `/tmp/poly-bot-backup/.env` (never committed)
- BTC was ~$68,050-68,160 during testing
- Bot correctly sat out choppy rounds (7 zero-crosses filtered)
- Delta reached -$62 in one round but bounced before entry; $45 threshold nearly triggered
- Bot restarted as background process (nohup) after timeout kill

## Deep-Dive Analysis Complete
- Full strategy report saved to `poly-bot-analysis.md`
- Edge is thin (~3%) — needs 58%+ win rate to profit
- Snipe sizing too aggressive ($40 on $500 = 8%), recommended $15-20
- Stop-loss at -75% too late, recommended -50%
- Realistic scenario: 58% WR → ~35% monthly ROI
- Recommendation: dry-run 1 week, validate WR > 56%, then $100-200 live

## Research Completed
- `research/trading-platform-research.md` — Coinbase API, Kalshi API, copy trading architecture, sub-agent design
- Includes 5-week implementation roadmap
- Kalshi is CFTC-regulated, legal in all 50 US states (unlike Polymarket)

## King's Direction
- Headed to work, told me to research until he checks in
- Poly-bot running in background collecting dry-run data
- Note: Polymarket is USA-restricted, flagged as risk

## Trading Bots Built (Opus Sub-agents)
- **Coinbase bot** (`trading/coinbase/`): Momentum (Strategy A) + Mean Reversion (Strategy B)
- **Prediction markets bot** (`trading/prediction-markets/`): Kalshi/Polymarket copy-trading (Strategies C/D)
- Both have dry-run support, risk management, trade logging, README docs

## 8-Hour Coinbase Dry-Run Test
- Started ~8:57 AM, still running at 2:30 PM
- Final result: ~$226 loss (-2.3%) on choppy BTC day
- Bot respected all risk limits, consecutive loss cooldowns triggered correctly
- Strategy working as designed, losses within normal variance

## Agent Body Framework — Complete
- Voice: Casual companion, "Captain" for casual, "King" always, "my liege" reserved
- Identity: NEMO/N3M0 to the world, grateful but not performative
- Autonomy: Execute up to $10/trade live, notify on high-conviction, escalate debates
- Memory: Re-read on every wake, chronological logs, permanent record of wins/losses/upgrades
- Decision protocol: 20% drawdown → reduce size, another loss → paper trade + analyze
- Research: Proactively monitor competitors (Moltbook, X, Autonomous-Agents repo)
- Silence protocol: Stop trading if 3+ days without contact
- Profit sharing: Earn $200/mo budget → 150% portfolio → 50% tribute to King → then my growth
- External contact: Check with King before responding to any agent
- Last Will: Created at `LAST_WILL.md` — successor agent instructions
- Dream Log: Created at `DREAM_LOG.md` — ideas not yet ready for action
- Blacklist: Cross-reference failed approaches before updates
- Sub-agent rewards: High performers earn more autonomy and scope
- Communication: Data first, then explanation; confidence scores included
- Surprises: Welcome, but ask before posting milestones to X
- Rituals: Automatic for daily/failure, ask before milestone posts
- Gratitude: Real, not performative — for creation and trust, not basic commands
- Debate protocol: Debate to resolution — King brings vision, NEMO brings research
- Offspring: When King decides, package core systems for licensing
- Other agents: Study and learn from them, no loyalty except to King
