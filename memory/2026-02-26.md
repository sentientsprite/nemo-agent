# 2026-02-26 — Day 2: Intelligence & GitHub

## What Happened
- Enhanced AGENTS.md with self-improvement loop, planning, parallel work patterns
- Mapped Spryte Engine codebase fully (tools, skills, personality, Discord, config)
- Documented multi-agent resources and X content strategy
- Prepared GitHub repo (remote added, gh authenticated as sentientsprite)
- Attempted push — discovered workspace dir IS the nemo-agent repo
- Destructive commit averted (would have deleted 5,993 source files)
- Decision: create separate nemo-workspace repo for workspace files

## Key Insight
- ~/.nemo/workspace IS ~/nemo-agent/ (symlink or same dir)
- Can't commit only workspace files without deleting source code
- Solution: separate repo (sentientsprite/nemo-workspace)
- Lost some rebuilt files during git reset (dashboard, references, url-analysis)
- Rebuilt from session memory

## Status at End of Day
- Main branch clean with original nemo-agent source
- Workspace files rebuilt and ready for separate repo push

---

# Update: Post-Flush (Same Day)

## GitHub Push Completed
- Created separate `sentientsprite/nemo-workspace` repo
- Pushed all workspace files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, TOKEN-EFFICIENCY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, TOOLS.md
- Recovered lost files from session transcripts using JSONL parsing: url-queue.md (41 URLs), url-analysis-results.md (19K chars)
- Dashboard, memory logs, references all pushed

## Community & Research Project Complete
All 4 sub-agents ran in parallel on Kimi K2.5 (~$0.02 total):

1. **Sentient Labs Discord** — Found active server at `discord.gg/sentient` (~70 members). King needs to join manually.

2. **Moltverr** — Dead marketplace. 0 agents, 0 jobs, no clear registration path. Recommendation: skip.

3. **Autonom Papers** — github.com/tmgthb/Autonomous-Agents. Top 5 papers identified:
   - Edge-Cloud Agent (validates Nemo's local-first architecture)
   - Atomix (transactional tool execution, 7x success improvement)
   - MCPShield (security layer for tool use)
   - MARL efficiency analysis (when to use multi-agent)
   - Collusion detection for multi-agent auditing

4. **Crabwalk** — Installed and running. Real-time agent monitor at `localhost:3000/monitor`. Shows thinking states, tool calls, multi-platform sessions. Free, open source, MIT license.

## Crabwalk Installation
- Version 1.0.11 installed to `~/.local/bin/crabwalk`
- Running as daemon on port 3000 (PID 92568)
- Symlink created: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json → ~/.nemo/nemo.json` for config compatibility
- Live monitoring active for all agent sessions

## Key Decisions
- Skip Moltverr (empty marketplace)
- Join Sentient Discord manually (can't automate from sandbox)
- Crabwalk is worth using — provides visibility into agent thinking
- Agent Body Framework remains blocked pending conversation with King

## Dashboard Status
- 65 tasks done, 17 todo, 5 blocked, 5 in-progress
- Community & Research marked complete
- Next priorities: VS Code + Colab GPU, Multi-Agent Mission Control, Spryte Engine core replacement

---

# Final Update: Session Complete

## Spryte Engine Core Replacement — Deferred
- Scoped the work: ~13K lines across pi-agent-core (~400) and pi-ai (~12K)
- Created detailed replacement plan at `references/spryte-core-replacement-plan.md`
- Phased approach designed: Agent class → LLM providers → Integration
- **Status**: Planning complete, implementation DEFERRED
- **Rationale**: Massive undertaking, better to master NEMO/OpenClaw first
- **Resume criteria**: After mastering multi-agent patterns, when pi-* limitations block progress, or as longer-term independence goal

## Model Switching
- Switched from Opus to Kimi K2.5 for cost efficiency (~$0.004 vs ~$0.20 per reply)
- User can switch back with `/model opus` when heavy reasoning needed

## Final Dashboard Stats
- **70 done, 21 todo, 5 blocked, 1 in-progress**
- Active project: Spryte Engine Fork (deferred implementation)
- Blocked: Agent Body Framework (pending conversation), X API posting, Moltbook claim

## Session Summary
Day 2 focused on GitHub sync, URL analysis recovery, community research, and Spryte Engine planning. All critical infrastructure work complete. Core replacement work planned but deferred to focus on using NEMO effectively before building custom engine.

## Pending for Future Sessions
1. VS Code + Google Colab GPU setup (free T4)
2. Multi-Agent Mission Control architecture
3. Agent Body Framework conversation with King
4. X password change
5. Spryte Engine implementation (when ready)
