# Multi-Agent Resources

## Patterns to Study
- **Mission Control 10-Agent Pattern** — Coordinated agent teams with specialized roles
- **MS Agent Lightning** — Microsoft's multi-agent framework
- **Boris Cherny's 5 Tips** — Parallel worktrees, plan mode, AGENTS.md, skills, point-and-fix
- **@kloss_xyz Body Framework** — Brain/Muscles/Bones/DNA/Soul/Eyes/Heartbeat mapping

## Current Agent Architecture
- Main agent (Opus) — conversation, complex reasoning
- Sub-agents (Kimi K2.5) — delegated tasks, ~$0.004/task
- Cron jobs (Kimi K2.5) — scheduled tasks (daily security audit)
- Local models (LM Studio) — embeddings, memory (free)

## Future Plans
- Design sub-agent team with specialized roles
- VS Code + Google Colab free T4 GPU for larger models
- Explore Crabwalk for agent monitoring
