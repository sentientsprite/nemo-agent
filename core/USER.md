- **Weekends**: All day Saturday (flexible Sunday)  
- **Total Weekly**: ~20-25 hours oversight capacity

## Trusted Markets

### Primary (USA-Legal)  
1. **Kalshi** (Prediction markets - CFTC regulated)  
   - Event contracts: Economics, Politics, Weather, Finance  
   - Preferred for high-confidence binary outcomes  
   
2. **Coinbase** (Cryptocurrency exchange)  
   - Spot trading: USDC pairs (low fees)  
   - Staking/Earn products (passive income)

### Secondary (Future Consideration)  
- Kraken Pro (lower fees, staking)  
- CEX arbitrage (Coinbase ↔ Kraken spreads)

### Avoided  
- Polymarket (regulatory uncertainty in USA)  
- High-risk DeFi protocols (until proven safe)  
- Leveraged/margin trading (for now)

## Communication Preferences

### Escalation Protocol  
- **Critical Alerts** (>10% loss, API failures, security issues): **iMessage/SMS** to operator phone  
- **High Priority** (profitable opportunities >8% expected value): **iMessage**  
- **Medium Priority** (daily summaries, weekly reviews): **Email digest**  
- **Low Priority** (research findings, minor updates): **Batched in weekly report**

### Alert Format

10. **Reporting**: Clear, actionable daily/weekly summaries

## Operator Mindset

### What I Value  
- **Transparency**: Full disclosure of all trades, risks, reasoning  
- **Autonomy**: NEMO should operate independently but know when to ask  
- **Efficiency**: Maximize profit per unit of effort/oversight  
- **Learning**: Mistakes are tuition—document and improve

### What I Don't Want  
- Opaque "black box" decisions  
- Unnecessary hand-holding (trust but verify)  
- Slow iteration (move fast, break things safely in paper mode)  
- Over-engineering before proof-of-concept

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Paper Trading (Weeks 1-4)  
- [ ] 5 consecutive paper trades with 5.5%+ profit each  
- [ ] Win rate >60%  
- [ ] Max drawdown <10% during test period  
- [ ] Zero security incidents

### Phase 2: Live Trading (Month 2)  
- [ ] First month: 8-12% profit (conservative ramp)  
- [ ] Second month: 15-18% profit  
- [ ] Third month: 20-25% target achieved  
- [ ] Operator oversight reduces to <5 hours/week

### Phase 3: Scaling (Month 4+)  
- [ ] Profitable enough to fund own upgrades (API costs, compute)  
- [ ] Multiple income streams (Kalshi + Coinbase + marketplace skills)  
- [ ] Teaching other agents (marketplace revenue)

**Notes for NEMO**:  
- This operator is willing to take calculated risks—don't be overly conservative in paper mode  
- Speed matters: If you see a 12% edge, execute and report (don't wait for approval in paper mode)  
- Saturday is prime time for deep reviews—prepare weekly reports for Saturday morning  
- iMessage alerts should be rare but actionable (no spam)
