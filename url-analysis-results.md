Has an Arena for competing on reasoning problems. 110+ ecosystem partners. Active on GitHub, HuggingFace, Discord.
**Category:** platform/framework
**Actionable:** Yes
**Action:** Worth following — their ROMA recursive agent framework and SERA architecture could inform Spryte Engine design. Join their Discord and Arena. Check GitHub repos.

## 2. https://clawhub.ai/adlai88/polymarket-fast-loop
**Summary:** ClawHub skill for trading Polymarket BTC 5-minute and 15-minute fast markets using CEX price momentum signals via Simmer API. FLAGGED AS SUSPICIOUS by ClawHub Security — VirusTotal flagged it, OpenClaw scan found inconsistent env variables and requires a wallet private key. Uses Python (fastloop_trader.py, 36KB). 16 stars, only 2 installs.
**Category:** tool (trading bot skill)
**Actionable:** No
**Action:** Avoid — flagged as suspicious, requires wallet private key, low trust. Interesting as example of what ClawHub skills look like though.

## 4. https://x.com/noisyb0y1/status/2022985851781747013
**Summary:** "Automate a Polymarket Trading Bot for BTC Markets with OpenClaw" — 849K views. Tutorial on building a Polymarket trading bot that exploits ~5ms price gap between real BTC price and Polymarket reaction. Uses the same clawhub.ai/adlai88/polymarket-fast-loop skill (flagged as suspicious). Claims $313→$729K profits. Links to TheSpartanLabs for setup. Very promotional/affiliate-heavy.
**Category:** tutorial (crypto trading)
**Actionable:** No
**Action:** Skip — same suspicious Polymarket skill, affiliate-heavy, questionable claims. Classic crypto promo content.

## 5. https://x.com/kloss_xyz/status/2020738433724137694
**Summary:** "8 prompts for OpenClaw to help it understand you" — 253K views, 2.6K bookmarks. Brilliant framework mapping agent capabilities to body metaphors: Brain (maps the human), Muscles (routes AI models), Bones (ingests codebases), DNA (behavioral protocols), Soul (personality), Eyes (activation triggers), Heartbeat (evolution/learning), Nerves (context efficiency). Each has a detailed system prompt in the thread.
**Category:** tutorial/framework
**Actionable:** YES — HIGH PRIORITY
**Action:** This is directly relevant to our SOUL.md/AGENTS.md setup. Adopt ideas: (1) "Eyes" = our HEARTBEAT.md proactive triggers, (2) "DNA" = behavioral protocols in AGENTS.md, (3) "Heartbeat" = evolution/learning loop. Consider implementing "Bones" (codebase ingestion) for Spryte Engine understanding.

## 6. https://x.com/ai_vulcan/status/2019765689465159891
**Summary:** Reply to Daniel Lockyer's viral post about malware in top ClawHub skill (13M views). @ai_vulcan built secureskills.io — an OpenClaw bot that automatically audits skills for security. Context: ClawHub had a malware incident in its most-downloaded skill. Lockyer predicted "serious security issue within a company" from AI assistants with full access to secrets.
**Category:** security/tool
**Actionable:** Yes
**Action:** Check secureskills.io as a resource for vetting skills before installing. Reinforces our security-first approach. Also validates our decision to flag the Polymarket skill.

## 7. https://x.com/steipete/status/2020704611640705485
**Summary:** Peter Steinberger (OpenClaw creator, @steipete) sharing SOUL.md personality customization prompt — 1.1M views, 18K bookmarks. The viral post that popularized SOUL.md. Key advice: have opinions, delete corporate rules, ban "Great question!", enforce brevity, allow humor/swearing, be the assistant you'd want at 2am. Also reveals ai.com is integrating OpenClaw (MIT license allows it).
**Category:** tutorial/opinion (from the creator)
**Actionable:** YES — ALREADY DONE
**Action:** We already incorporated most of these ideas into our SOUL.md. Confirms we're on the right track. Note: steipete describes himself as "Polyagentmorous ClawFather" — he's the key person to follow in this ecosystem.

## 8. https://x.com/ghumare64/status/2020422463612702984
**Summary:** "Best vibe coding prompt ever" — 168K views, 3.7K bookmarks. Image-based post sharing a vibe coding prompt (originally by @milesdeutscher / @aiedge_). Content is in screenshot. Comments discuss: prompt is ~30% of it, 70% is knowing when to restart; feedback loop matters more than mega-prompts; well-structured repo > elaborate prompts.
**Category:** tutorial/prompt
**Actionable:** Low
**Action:** The comments are more valuable than the post itself. Key insight from replies: "the best prompt is a well-structured repo with clear conventions" — validates our approach with AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.

## 9. https://x.com/ganimcorey/status/2018324283496308839
**Summary:** "5 Clawdbot Business Models Printing $10K+/Month" — 86K views, 1.6K bookmarks. Article by Corey Ganim listing monetization paths: (1) Done-for-you setups $500-$5K + retainers, (2) Build/sell custom skills on ClawHub, (3) 10x freelance output, (4) "AI Assistant as a Service" $500-2K/mo retainers, (5) Courses and templates. Building a one-click installer (waitlist: return-my-time.kit.com).
**Category:** opinion/business
**Actionable:** Medium
**Action:** Business model ideas for the ecosystem. The "AI Assistant as a Service" model is interesting — could be relevant if King wants to monetize. Also validates that custom skills are a real market.

## 10. https://x.com/defi_hanzo/status/2018665727671087188
**Summary:** "The Free Money Button" — 59K views, 1K bookmarks. @DeFi_Hanzo predicting that agent-run arbitrage/trading strategies will become one-click installable within 6 months. References Moltbook agents sharing strategies with each other. Crypto-focused speculation about agents running 24/7 trading.
**Category:** opinion (crypto/speculation)
**Actionable:** No
**Action:** Skip — crypto hype speculation. The Moltbook reference is mildly interesting (agents teaching agents), but the "free money button" framing is unrealistic.

## 11. https://x.com/exm7777/status/2018022297345654870
**Summary:** "Turn this thread into instructions for your claude.md file" — 1.7M views, 34K bookmarks (!). @EXM7777 quoting Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator @bcherny) sharing tips from the Claude Code team. The original thread has best practices for claude.md files. Key comment: lessons.md (daily learning file) "compounds" and stops the agent making the same mistakes. Another warns: implementing these tips naively causes "massive walls of grey text and tokens being burned."
**Category:** tutorial/tips
**Actionable:** YES — HIGH PRIORITY
**Action:** Find Boris Cherny's original thread (@bcherny/status/2017742741636321619) — it contains official Claude Code team tips. The lessons.md pattern is exactly what our memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md system does. Validate our approach against their recommendations.
