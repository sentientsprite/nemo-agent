## 6. Conclusion

Polymarket represents a rapidly maturing prediction market with significant opportunities for AI-driven trading strategies. The regulatory landscape is shifting positively at the federal level, though international restrictions are tightening. Key edges exist in information arbitrage, cross-platform pricing inefficiencies, and the newly launched volatility products.

AI agents should position for this evolution while maintaining strict risk management given the binary nature of event outcomes.
